## Assignment #1 - DECIDE
## A decision program for an anti-ballistic missile system
This program, known as DECIDE, generates a boolean signal to determine whether an interceptor missile should be launched.

The program receives input in the form of data points on a two-dimensional plane as well as some other parameters.
This input is measured against a set of Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs). The boolean output of these conditions make up the Conditions Met Vector (CMV).

Not all LICs are taken into account at every run instance of the DECIDE function - the values of the Preliminary Unlocking Vector (PUV) represent which LICs actually matter in every run.
